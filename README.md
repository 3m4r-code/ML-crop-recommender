This project is a web application that recommends to the user what type of 
agricultural crop is the most suitable overall to plant given the conditions of the 
weather and soil. 
The user inputs the required data fields: Nitrogen content –
Phosphorous content – Potassium content – Temperature – Humidity – PH value 
– Rainfall, then the program will use a classification algorithm to predict what 
crop will yield the best harvest. This project is important because farmers always 
want to maximize their harvest, to produce more food with better quality which 
reduces water and energy waste, which will greatly benefit society as a whole.
